						Welcome apprentices to the session and explain that we will be looking at various tools they may wish to use to support their analysis. The aim is for them to understand what tools are available and be able to justify their use (or non use) in their portfolio. First we will cover Big Data and then look at data platforms. Tomorrow we will start to code in R as a final tool. Select a warmup from <a href='https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jrSQya9EVyTf0t5e1FTP0g-jJOz6Lzw0g7xjJoixojk/edit?usp=sharing'> here</a>.

						What do apprentices think of the quote? 
						<br>
						Organisations will need to continuously adapt to be competitive due to the ever growing amount of data that is being generated. Not only storing this data but analysing it too, especially when it is not in usual structures.
						<br>
						Big Data is not just about volume but velocity too. Data is growing exponentially and companies need to keep up. Apart from storage there is no real limit to how big 'Big Data' can be, but for it to be considered 'Big Data' it needs to be sufficiently large that traditional processors (like your computer) cannot handle it.

						Quick question: how much data do you think twitter processes each day?

						Our current definition of Big Data is that it is too big for your computer, but let's consider a more robust approach to defining it. Industry experts refer to the 5 v's as metrics to evaluate whether data is Big or not. These are volume, velocity, variety, veracity and value. We will go through each of these in turn.

						The most obvious metric is its volume- how much data there is. If it is too big for your computer to handle (like Peta or Exa-bytes) then it is Big. 20 years ago Gigabytes would have been considered 'Big.' Ask apprentices to annotate the screen to suggest challenges that can occur due to the size of data (e.g. processing time, storage limits, etc). Also ask them to consider the volume of the data they use regularly.

							This refers to the quality of the data. What pitfalls can arise due to poor quality data? These issues are much worse with Big Data as there is so much of it, and any errors can lead to catastrophic failures which can be both expensive and time consuming. You should always have checks then for your incoming data- has it been normalised? Has it been cleaned? Have the structures been checked and processes put in place to deal with them? Never assume data is clean! As Big Data often comes from a disparate variety of sources, this can be challenging- especially when you also have to consider issues around ownership, GDPR and company data policies. Considering how expensive it can be to use Big Data, you do not want to find your analysis has been ruined due to issues around data quality- it could be both a frustrating and expensive mistake.

						Finally the value of the data. It is all well and good to have access to Big Data, but it is pointless if you cannot leverage it into something valuable like making a profit. You should always ask what the added value or return on investment is when considering using Big Data. Consider also that utilising Big Data technologies can be expensive (as unless you own the server you will have to rent it) as well as the environmental impact of these remote servers working at high capacity. Can you justify your use of Big Data when considering how much it will cost?

							Walk through the process. For example, say you wanted help choosing a take away. First your local device would send the recording of your instruction to its server and interpret the sound. Once it has identified the instruction (e.g. 'find takeaway') it would use the internet to find local takeaways to your location. Potentially based on your metadata (for example if you use Just Eat which has an Alexa app) Alexa would be able to predict which cusine you would most likely choose. It would then return these results to you, via the server where it will have worked out what 'sounds' (words) it will need to speak to you.

							<h2 style='color:#4d61f4'><strong>Divide and Conquer</strong></h2>
							<p style='color:#242456'> Most Big Data softwares use an approach called 'Divide and Conquer' where the data will be split into smaller 'chunks' and processed simultaneously across different nodes and the results combined. This process happens over several servers so if one fails the analysis can continue and the remaining can pick up the slack. </p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<!-- Slide 24 Notes -->
					<aside class='notes'>
						Has anyone ever tried to run analysis on a dataset that runs into millions of rows? How long did it take? When using Excel or a Jupyter Notebook the processing is being done by your computer. There are very powerful personal computers you can buy, but these are often optimised for computer games. Most of the computers we use are only powerful enough to handle a few Gigabytes which severly limits how quickly (and how much) data can be processed. 
						<br>
						This is where Big Data technologies come to the rescue. Instead of running your algorithm on your computer, you send the data to a remote server (run by a Big Data company) where your algorithm/script will run. The server uses an approach called 'divide and conquer' where it will share the data across several nodes and process them seperately before combining the results and sending them back. When you consider how powerful the processors these servers have you can see how much faster your analysis will be completed when using Big Data technology. This is especially true when the data is in large volume and fast moving, with Big Data servers able to store huge quantities and even have capabilities to deal with different data types and structures. Another advantage of spreading the data across different nodes is that if one fails for whatever reason, the others can pick up the slack. Compare this to running analysis on your computer- if it loses power midway through a large piece of analysis you will lose everything.

							Ask the apprentices for their answers (can use annotate or chat function) before revealing solution. Note that the second method is 10 times faster. This shows how much quicker dividing your processing up can be when using Big Data technologies. However, sending your data to a Big Data server can be expensive as you are effectively 'renting' someone else's processors. What you need to weigh up is the cost of using the technology against the added value of processing larger amounts of data more quickly and efficiently (again when you consider the capabilities of dealing with different data types). Something else to consider is accuracy- you do not want to make a mistake. Sending some data to the cloud to find that you had made a syntax error or some of the data was corrupt (or not cleaned properly) will not only be frustrating but potentially expensive to your employer as well.

The potential benefits will often outweigh the costs, but you will need to be confident that the added value is worth it. This will need to be justified to relevant stakeholders before the technology is used. It is paramount then that you are sure the analysis/algorithm will run smoothly, having quality assured your data and code to ensure there are no syntax errors and that the data is clean. Any mistakes could potentially costly to you and your business.

Licensed by Apache, this software came up with the MapReduce (divide and conquer) method which revolutionised data analysis as we know it. 
						<br>
						Also licensed by Apache is Spark, developed by the University of California, Berkeley this technology excels at parallel processing and dealing with faults.
						<br>
						AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a cloud based server owned by Amazon which allow users to store and process data, host scripts (such as plotly dashboards) and various analytics. Fun fact: AWS makes as much money for Amazon as the rest of the business combined.
						<br>
						A recent technology is Microsoft Azure which allows for cloud based computing which integrates well with other Microsoft softwares such as PowerBI
						<br>
						BigQuery is owned by Google and is effective at running SQL queries on a large scale.

						Big Data is not the only technology that you have available to use. Your employers have likely licensed several tools you can use to help you in your analysis. In this section we will discuss a few and consider the advantages they have. The aim is again for you to think about the tools you use and justify their use in your portfolio.
						<br>
						First we will consider visualisation suites such as Tableau or PowerBI. Built upon pre exisiting code, these allow you to produce impressive visualisations quickly and without a technical knowledge of coding. Allowing for the incorporation of company branding, it is simple to build dashboards and powerful visuals to support your analysis and presentations. Tableau has capabilities for working with live data as well as analytics tools (PowerBI has these as well) which can help you leverage insights without having to code. Drawbacks include not having complete control over the building process as well as being limited to whatever has been built in. Can anyone think of other pros and cons of using visualisation softwares?
						<br>
						Most of us are aware of Microsoft Excel as a tool for managing data. With an intuitive interface and the ability to manipulate data down to the cell level it is often the go to choice for analysing data (especially EDA and calculating aggregates). Excel does have data limits (1 million rows) and searching/filtering can be tedious when compared to Python. Excel does integrate with Jupyter Notebook and Python allowing for a best of both worlds approach.
						<br>
						In DS2 we looked at hypothesis testing in Python and in the next session we will start looking into R as a language for statistcal analysis. Both Python and R require a technical coding knowledge, meaning many employers and academic institutions look to software like SPSS (owned by IBM). SPSS uses a tabular approch not too dissimilar to Excel and has a range of inbuilt statistical analysese with simply prensented outputs. However, it is expensive to license and has been around since 1968- and it shows. It is not reactive to the latest developments and again you are limited to what you have built in.
						<br>
						Ask apprentices to describe the tools they use, like Knime, Alteryx, Qlikview, Jira, etc. How do they use them? What are the advantages and disadvantages? Encourage them to think in terms of business context. Stress again that they need to justify these reasons in their portfolio.

						Ask apprentices to suggest some advantages of platforms before revealing them. Draw attention to the ease of use, the tech support and the increased engagement from stakeholders. For coding you can discuss how you have more control over the entire process from data cleaning, analysis to visualisations (and potentially dashboars). Coding also has a supportive community and is also cheap.

							Again you can ask apprentices to suggest the disadvantages for both before revealing. Platforms are expensive, limited and can be difficult to use. On top of this you have issues around third parties potentially having access to your data as well as complications around switching platforms (upskilling staff, different formats, etc). Coding has a steep learning curve and is a constantly evolving discipline which requires analysts to keep abreast of. Another issue is around the open source nature of languages where importing libraries can potentilly bring in security risks.

							On top of this, platforms limit what you can do and can be expensive. Coding requires constant checks (easy to make mistakes) and is harder to present to stakeholders. Is there anything else we should consider?

							<p> Mr Jones works in a data analytics department and has been given a project to complete. He must design a dashboard that displays daily KPIs for his stakeholders.

							In teams you will be each be assigned a different product (Tableau, Python, etc) and will come up with arguments to convince Mr Jones to use your product. 

							Each team will then be given 1 minute to pitch their product.

						Put apprentices into groups of 3 or 4 and give them 7 minutes to come up with arguments to support their software. They will each be given a minute elevator pitch to convince Mr Jones to use their software (choose Python, Excel, Tableau/PowerBI and a software they use in their role (if closed cohort)). Let each group present their pitch. Remind apprentices again that for their portfolios it is crucial they justify their use of tools or coding by considering the alternative.
