						Welcome apprentices to the session and explain that we will be looking at various tools they may wish to use to support their analysis. The aim is for them to understand what tools are available and be able to justify their use (or non use) in their portfolio. First we will cover Big Data and then look at data platforms. Tomorrow we will start to code in R as a final tool.

						What do apprentices think of the quote? 
						<br>
						Organisations will need to continuously adapt to be competitive due to the ever growing amount of data that is being generated. Not only storing this data but analysing it too, especially when it is not in usual structures.
						<br>
						Big Data is not just about volume but velocity too. Data is growing exponentially and companies need to keep up. Apart from storage there is no real limit to how big 'Big Data' can be, but for it to be considered 'Big Data' it needs to be sufficiently large that traditional processors (like your computer) cannot handle it.

						Quick question: how much data do you think twitter processes each day?

						Our current definition of Big Data is that it is too big for your computer, but let's consider a more robust approach to defining it. Industry experts refer to the 5 v's as metrics to evaluate whether data is Big or not. These are volume, velocity, variety, veracity and value. We will go through each of these in turn.
					</aside>        
        </section>
        <section>
					<h2 style='color:#1d98ff'><b>Volume</b> </h2>
					<div class='r-hstack'>
						<ul style='display:inline-block;text-align:left'>
							<li> Refers to the size of the data </li>
							<br>
							<li> Whether a dataset is considered 'big' or not is dependent on the volume </li>
							<br>
							<li> Data is considered Big when it is too voluminous for traditional data storage methods </li>
							<br>
							<li> Big Data platforms provide a way to store incredibly large amounts of data as well the ability to process it efficiently  </li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						<img src='https://source.unsplash.com/HjpNeUD8qdw/800x600' alt='Volume'>
					</div>
					<aside class='notes'>
						The most obvious metric is its volume- how much data there is. If it is too big for your computer to handle (like Peta or Exa-bytes) then it is Big. 20 years ago Gigabytes would have been considered 'Big.' Ask apprentices to annotate the screen to suggest challenges that can occur due to the size of data (e.g. processing time, storage limits, etc). Also ask them to consider the volume of the data they use regularly.

        </section>
        <section>
					<h2 style='color:#1d98ff'><b>Velocity</b> </h2>
					<div class='r-hstack'>
						<ul style='display:inline-block;text-align:left'>
							<li> Refers to the speed of data generation </li>
							<br>
							<li> For example, how fast data flows in from sources such as application logs, networks and social media sites </li>
							<br>
							<li> Typically the flow will be massive and continuous </li>
							<br>
							<li> Increasingly companies are looking to stream analytics and data so it available at the right time to make appropriate business decisions </li>
							<br>
							<li> Big Data platforms offer solutions to dealing with fast flowing data in terms of storage and processing </li>

          	<img src='https://source.unsplash.com/3HUz8RghGfw/800x600' alt='Velocity'>     
					</div>  
					<aside class='notes'>
						Velocity refers to the speed of data generation, twitter feeds and stock markets generate data incredibly quickly and what is 'fresh' can go out of data within minutes. 'Big Data' will typically be massive and continuous and will require powerful processors to keep up. What challenges can we think of that arise from the velocity of our data? What are the potential benefits of harnessing fast flowing data?

        </section>
        <section>
					<h2 style='color:#1d98ff'><b>Variety</b> </h2>
          <div class="r-hstack">
						<ul style='display:inline-block;text-align:left'>
							<li> Refers to the heterogeniety of the data sources </li>
							<br>
							<li> In other words, how different the data sources are (unstructured vs structured etc) </li>
							<br>
							<li> With large flows of data from several of sources it is possible that there will be a variety of data types and structures</li>
							<br>
							<li> Big Data platforms can handle a variety of sources, structures and data types </li>
							<br>
							<li> Different types of data require different strategies which you will need to consider as part of your analysis </li>                 
						</ul>
						<br>
          	<img src='https://source.unsplash.com/2zJhA9RSkys/800x600' alt='Variety'>
          </div>
					<aside class='notes'>
						Variety refers to the different types of data. WHat are the different types we learned way back in module 1? The heterogeneity of data sources is super important with Big Data- what challenges can arise if our incoming data is of different structures? You will need ETL systems that can move the data into warehouses where it can be cross referenced or joined. Fortunately Big Data systems often have methods to deal with these. What use cases can we think of for combining different data sources on a large scale?
					</aside>
        </section>
        <section>
					<h2 style='color:#1d98ff'><b>Veracity</b> </h2>
					<div class='r-hstack'>
						<ul style='display:inline-block;text-align:left'>
							<li> Refers to the quality of the data </li>
							<br>
							<li> Checking the veracity of data sources is always challenging- <b> never trust data as given </b> </li>
							<br>
							<li> Enquire about the data preparation- has it been normalised already? Has it been subject to statistical manipulation (i.e. outliers removed)? </li>
							<br>
							<li> Where possible you should always ask to look at raw data </li>
							<br>
							<li> Determining veracity can be challenging to an organisations policies as well as externally determining authorship/ownership </li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						<img src='https://source.unsplash.com/KgLtFCgfC28/800x600' alt='Veracity'>
					</div>    
					<aside class='notes'>
						This refers to the quality of the data. What pitfalls can arise due to poor quality data? These issues are much worse with Big Data as there is so much of it, and any errors can lead to catastrophic failures which can be both expensive and time consuming. You should always have checks then for your incoming data- has it been normalised? Has it been cleaned? Have the structures been checked and processes put in place to deal with them? Never assume data is clean! As Big Data often comes from a disparate variety of sources, this can be challenging- especially when you also have to consider issues around ownership, GDPR and company data policies.

        </section>
        <section>
					<h2 style='color:#1d98ff'><b>Value</b> </h2>
          <div class="r-hstack">    
						<ul style='display:inline-block;text-align:left'>
							<li> Refers to the business value of the data </li>
							<br>
							<li> Having access to vast amounts of fast flowing data is useless unless it can leveraged into something of value </li>
							<br>
							<li> How does this data add value to your business? What is the ROI?</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						<img src='https://source.unsplash.com/LVcjYwuHQlg/800x600' alt='Value'>
          </div>
					<aside class='notes'>
						Finally the value of the data. It is all well and good to have access to Big Data, but it is pointless if you cannot leverage it into something valuable like making a profit. You should always ask what the added value or return on investment is when considering using Big Data. Consider also that utilising Big Data technologies can be expensive (as unless you own the server you will have to rent it) as well as the environmental impact of these remote servers working at high capacity. Can you justify your use of Big Data when considering how much it will cost?

              <p style='color:white'> Most Big Data softwares use an approach called 'Divide and Conquer' where the data will be split into smaller 'chunks' and processed simultaneously across different nodes and the results combined. This process happens over several servers so if one fails the analysis can continue and the remaining can pick up the slack. </p>
