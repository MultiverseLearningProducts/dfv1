						<!-- Slide 5b Notes -->
					 <aside class='notes'>
						 Read the quote and ask apprentices if any use such processes in their role. Essentially data synchronization is about instantaneous updates so all users are using the most up to date versions and information at any one time. Unlike data integration which typically requires batch uploads and downtime, a data synchronization process should have 100% uptime with continuous flow of data and updates.

					<!-- Slide 7 Notes -->
					<aside class='notes'>
						Data synchronization allows for instant updates in a file meaning any user is going to have access to the most up to date version which will allow for more efficient decision making. It is also easier to avoid conflicts as problems can be identified in real time and therefore dealt with (unlike data integration where conflicts may arise if the sources were not scoped properly). Ask apprentices if they can think up any potential issues around synchronization (e.g. may be hard to maintain control, cost of keeping something online 100%, velocity of systems with large amounts of data, etc)- we will cover these later.

            <!-- Slide 10a Notes -->
            <aside class='notes'>
							File synchronization ensures that when one file is updated in one location, all other locations are updated too. It is like instant messaging on WhatsApss (or other similar products) where when one person sends a message, all other people in the thread see what it is instantly. Ask apprentices if they can think of other examples of this.

            <!-- Slide 11a Notes -->
            <aside class='notes'>
							In file synchronization any updates to a file are reflected immediately for all users, as all users are accessing the same file from different locations. In version control users will be using (and updating) different versions of the same file such that if an update is made, no-one else is made aware until the different versions are merged together. In other words, changes are not updated automatically.

            <!-- Slide 11b Notes -->
            <aside class='notes'>
							This process allows for different people to work on the same project at the same time without the risk of their work accidentally being overwritten or messed around with as they are working. All changes are tracked (every user can review these) so if a mistake is made, it is easy to revert to a previous version. When merging versions together it is possible conflicts will arise (two people have edited the same part) so there will need to be a conflict resolution process to deal with these.

					<!-- Slide 12 Notes -->
					<aside class='notes'>
						So apprentices are clear on the difference between the two systems: file synchronization allows for instant updates so is more agile, version control allows users to work independently so is easier to control and spot conflicts/mistakes. Both have their advantages (and disadvantages) but in truth, both incorporate something of each other. For example, Google suite applications such as Google Documents allow for file synchrnonization while also maintaining a version control to see all updates. Most version control tools use some sort of file synchronization such that when an update is made, all users can see the change before merging.

          <!-- Slide 13 Notes -->
          <aside class='notes'>
						A distributed file system (DFS) is very common where users are accessing shared files over a Local Area Network (LAN). For example, having a shared drive on your PC. Where this differs from file synchronization is that it often doesn't allow multiple users to edit the same file at the same time- other users would have to wait until the person editing has saved and closed the file.

							An issue with data synchronization is around security- ensuring that data is not leaked which could lead to issues with GDPR and other consequences. This would normally arise due to the wrong people been given access to the system. Ask the apprentices to suggest solutions.

						<!-- Slide 18b Notes -->
						<aside class='notes'>
							Simply, the solution is to have policies and access requirements- including a named person (or persons) whose job it is to manage access. This will include reviewing regularly who has access and revoking it if no longer required. It will also help to implement some sort of encryption process.

							This is to do with the management of the system, ensuring the process works such that if an update is made it is available to all users.

						<!-- Slide 20b Notes -->

							Again it comes down to policies and systems. Ideally there should be someone who is in charge of version control and maintains the 'master' version to ensure it is always up to date and correct. You may also want to implement a system where if someone wants to make an edit, it needs to be approved by a moderator before going live. Software like GitHub alerts the repository owner if there are any conflicts with versions which can help manage data quality.

What visualisations did you produce to justify this? Keep in mind this is part of planning, you are not yet talking about how you built the model- just what you planned to do.
