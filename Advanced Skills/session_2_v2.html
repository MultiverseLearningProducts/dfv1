					<p style='font-size:35px'> Gateway is simply a meeting. We will go through and confirm all evidence has been uploaded before discussing next steps and then:</p>
					<ul style='font-size:35px;display:inline-block;text-align:left'>
						<li> Submitting your Gateway Checklist (we send you the link)</li>

					<!-- Slide 11 Notes -->
					<aside class='notes'>
						Gateway is simply a meeting where we will agree you are ready for your end point assessment. We will send you the checklist and go through it in the meeting. We will work with you over the next couple of months (reviewing evidence, etc) to help you prepare.

							Throughout the project you will be simulating 6 elements of a standard piece of analysis. They want to see how you take a task outside of your own environment and apply what you have learnt. The assessors want you to make assumptions. There is no pass or fail but reflection is key to show understanding. If you didn’t get the outputs you wanted, explain what happened and why. As long as you noted that and put it in your discussion/notes/reflection, it is okay! The expectation is that you work on the project as you might in your workplace.
