						<aside class='notes'>
							Yesterday we saw what a RDBMS is and how it is structured. The purpose of this was to help you with writing queries to retrieve data. However, if you want to get an overview of the database, looking at the tables themselves will be a chore. Data models are a type of metadata that explain how a database is structured, showing the relationships between tables and what is contained in each.

								A data model will ensure that every object (tables) are accurately represented, allowing users to see what information is available and what the relationships are between tables. Having a model will make it easier to design databases (imagine trying to build a house without a blueprint...). Having data models will also help define relationships between tables and help identify where data may be missing. When you create a database you should know what data is being uploaded, and therefore by having an overview model you can see what is missing, or redundant.

							When designing a database through data models you will follow three stages. You will start with a conceptual model which will be used as a basis for building a logical model. Adding in other business requirements will see the creation of a physical model where the data will be added and the database implemented.

								Starting with the conceptual model, there is hardly any detail available on the actual database structure.

								Conceptual models are the basic building blocks of database design which allow users to experiment with different ideas and can be used for a variety of business purposes. An advantage at this early stage of development is that technical requirements such as hardware is not considered, allowing the user to design the system they want and then find a system that will accomodate it.

								Once the model is conceptually built, it is time to think about how the data may look. At this point you will be aware of what the data is, so you will want to define the data types as this will determine what sort of analysis will become available. At this early development stage the relationships will not be fully definied, so you won't need to think about keys. All you need to state is what tables will ultimately be related to each other.

								What do we mean by data types? In module 1 we thought about quantitative and qualitative and structures, but we can expland on this by looking at how an individual piece of data may be stored. The basic type of data is string (sometimes called a character or variable character) is simply characters, like letters which can be formed into words (or other objects like serial numbers or urls for example). String data types are difficult to analyse of themselves, but can be examined for their length, how often they appear or as a basis for aggregation (average number of drinks sold per shop). Integers are whole numbers whereas if it involves a decimal it will be called (depending on the system) a number, decimal or floating point number (float). Most softwares recognise datetime as a separate data type due to how time behaves differently to most numbers. Finally is boolean, also known as True or False. A binary field which indicates if something is 'on' or 'off'. True often has value 1, and False 0.

							<!-- Slide 9d Notes-->
							<aside class='notes'>
								A logical model is used in the development of a database, but an advantage is that if you want to integrate with an existing database at this stage you can plan out how this will work. As previously mentioned, a logical model is developed before deciding on the database management system- so you can design what you want and decide if a RDBMS, NoSQL or any other database management system is the most appropriate.

								Finally we have the physical model. At this point you are almost ready to implement the database and know which data is going to be uploaded. At this point you will also look at the business and performance requirements of the database and start to incorporate them. This will include looking at hardware requirements (i.e. where will the data be stored?) and software requirements (database management system). A physical model will demonstrate how the data in the database is stored, how different entities are related and what the keys are (if a RDBMS).

								There are two types of entity, strong and weak. Strong entities have primary keys and do not require another entity to exist. Think transactional tables where recent sales are recorded.

Weak entities require other entities to exist to make sense, i.e. their primary key is a foreign key in another table. Reference tables like product information are examples of these.

								There are different ways of representing an ERD, but we will be using the Crow Foot notation. This is an example of a one to one relationship, where one record in one table relates directly to one record in another. Imagine a table where every row was a person and in the other table was their passport information. Each person should only have one passport so this would be a one-to-one relationship.

							<!-- Slide 15c Notes-->
							<aside class='notes'>
								A one to many relationship exists when one record in a table relates to several tables in another (the opposite many-to-one exists as well). Imagine a table full of customers and another a list of products sold in a single transaction. One person will have bought many (or one) product and so will be a one to many relationship. Can anyone give an example of a many to one relationship (e.g. customers buying the same product)

							<!-- Slide 15e Notes-->
							<aside class='notes'>
								It is possible using crow foot notation for a relationship object to demonstrate an 'or' relationship. A circle represents zero (records in one table relate to none in the other). However, you can combine two cardinal entities together (e.g. zero or many). An example of this is a table full of customers and a table full of products available. A customer may buy several products or the may buy none. It is common to see zero or one, zero or many and one or many (although the many symbol by default means one or many).

								Ask an apprentice to explain this ERD. The student_course table holds a record for each course a student is enrolled on, meaning that one student will be referenced several times in that table (hence one to many). Likewise, due to the composite key, each course may also be referenced multiple times (it is possible only one student is enrolled on a course) but will have only one record in the course table. Hence one-or-many to one.

								(You may need to refresh screen if chart doesn't appear) Again ask apprentices to try and read this table. For each item sold in a transaction there will exist a unique row which will be identified by the transaction number, customer id and product id. This means that each customer can be referenced in several records in the transaction table, hence one to one-or-many. Likewise, a product can be sold more than once but will only have one record in the product table. Several products may be sold by the same supplier. If a transaction contains more than one product, they will likely be shipped together (but the shipping information will only appear in one record). However, a customer may choose to pick up the item in store, so it won't have been shipped, hence the one-or-many to zero-or-one relationship (we will ignore the case where a transaction can be shipped seperately). Several shipments may be carried by the same shipper. Finally, a customer may have bought several products across several transactions which is why there is a one-or-many to one relationship.

								Broadly we can group our strategies to dealing with problems into 3 categories. The first is read the error message. Python, R, SQL, Excel and more often give you an error message when something goes wrong, telling you what the issue is (and sometimes how to fix it). This is the same in databases or other computer systems. When you have a problem, check for error messages (this may mean retrieving log files) to see what the problem is. If that doesn't help, you can always try Googling the error message to see if someone else has a solution.

								Some things we enter into a table can be rather long (email addresses, URLs, your full name) and depending on the structure of the table these could be truncated (cut off) if the entity is too short to store the entire value. Some systems will try to fit entire values into their view width which can be heavy on memory. You will need to ensure that your system can deal with long values, for example, if a value is too long for a cell in Microsoft Excel, it hides the parts which are too long while maintaining their value.

								Many file types such as CSV or Excel do not demand that every data type must be the same within a field. When you upload to a database this will be enforced, meaning you may have some unexpected issues. For example, if part of your automated analysis involves performing a calculation on a numerical field in a database and that field has been converted to string because of a data mismatch, then your process will break. Be careful to check your data types before uploading.

						<!-- Slide 39 Notes-->

							Issues can arise when our data sets are too big- not only will they take up lots of memory, but queries will have to search through all the rows to find the information you need which is inefficient. You may want to consider hosting your data on a 'Big Data' server, or use a NoSQL database to deal with this. Sometimes performance issues come about due to the queries themselves, you can apply filters and limits to SQL queries which will reduce the amount of data it has to sort through. Whenever you join tables together time will be added to the query, and finally, if your database has not been normalised properly then there will be redundant data which will slow down your processes.

							You would use an index! Assign each record in a database a value then retrieve the data by accessing the indices. This is opposed to sorting through the database (querying).

						<!-- Slide 44 Notes-->

							Denormalising means introducing redundant data to our tables to speed up processes. For example, if there is a join you are always doing, then consider creating a table with all that information combined so for future queries you do not need to join. Or, if there is a calculation you are always doing, then create a calculated field to avoid repeating this calculation. The pros of this process is that querying will be faster and simpler, but the cons are that it will be more difficult to update our tables, there may data inconsistencies and storage requirements will go up.
