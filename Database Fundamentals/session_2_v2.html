						<aside class='notes'>
							Yesterday we saw what a RDBMS is and how it is structured. The purpose of this was to help you with writing queries to retrieve data. However, if you want to get an overview of the database, looking at the tables themselves will be a chore. Data models are a type of metadata that explain how a database is structured, showing the relationships between tables and what is contained in each.

								A data model will ensure that every object (tables) are accurately represented, allowing users to see what information is available and what the relationships are between tables. Having a model will make it easier to design databases (imagine trying to build a house without a blueprint...). Having data models will also help define relationships between tables and help identify where data may be missing. When you create a database you should know what data is being uploaded, and therefore by having an overview model you can see what is missing, or redundant.

							When designing a database through data models you will follow three stages. You will start with a conceptual model which will be used as a basis for building a logical model. Adding in other business requirements will see the creation of a physical model where the data will be added and the database implemented.

							<!-- Slide 7c Notes-->
							<aside class='notes'>
								Conceptual models are the basic building blocks of database design which allow users to experiment with different ideas and can be used for a variety of business purposes. An advantage at this early stage of development is that technical requirements such as hardware is not considered, allowing the user to design the system they want and then find a system that will accomodate it.

								Once the model is conceptually built, it is time to think about how the data may look. At this point you will be aware of what the data is, so you will want to define the data types as this will determine what sort of analysis will become available. At this early development stage the relationships will not be fully definied, so you won't need to think about keys. All you need to state is what tables will ultimately be related to each other.

								What do we mean by data types? In module 1 we thought about quantitative and qualitative and structures, but we can expland on this by looking at how an individual piece of data may be stored. The basic type of data is string (sometimes called a character or variable character) is simply characters, like letters which can be formed into words (or other objects like serial numbers or urls for example). String data types are difficult to analyse of themselves, but can be examined for their length, how often they appear or as a basis for aggregation (average number of drinks sold per shop). Integers are whole numbers whereas if it involves a decimal it will be called (depending on the system) a number, decimal or floating point number (float). Most softwares recognise datetime as a separate data type due to how time behaves differently to most numbers. Finally is boolean, also known as True or False. A binary field which indicates if something is 'on' or 'off'. True often has value 1, and False 0.

							<!-- Slide 8d Notes-->
							<aside class='notes'>
								A logical model is used in the development of a database, but an advantage is that if you want to integrate with an existing database at this stage you can plan out how this will work. As previously mentioned, a logical model is developed before deciding on the database management system- so you can design what you want and decide if a RDBMS, NoSQL or any other database management system is the most appropriate.

								Finally we have the physical model. At this point you are almost ready to implement the database and know which data is going to be uploaded. At this point you will also look at the business and performance requirements of the database and start to incorporate them. This will include looking at hardware requirements (i.e. where will the data be stored?) and software requirements (database management system). A physical model will demonstrate how the data in the database is stored, how different entities are related and what the keys are (if a RDBMS).

								There are two types of entity, strong and weak. Strong entities have primary keys and do not require another entity to exist. Think transactional tables where recent sales are recorded.

Weak entities require other entities to exist to make sense, i.e. their primary key is a foreign key in another table. Reference tables like product information are examples of these.

This is an example of a one to one relationship, where one record in one table relates directly to one record in another. Imagine a table where every row was a person and in the other table was their passport information. Each person should only have one passport so this would be a one-to-one relationship.

								A one to many relationship exists when one record in a table relates to several tables in another (the opposite many-to-one exists as well). Imagine a table full of customers and another a list of products sold in a single transaction. One person will have bought many (or one) product and so will be a one to many relationship. Can anyone give an example of a many to one relationship (e.g. customers buying the same product)

								A many to many relationship occurs when many records in one table relate to many records in another.

								It is possible using crow foot notation for a relationship object to demonstrate an 'or' relationship. A circle represents zero (records in one table relate to none in the other). However, you can combine two cardinal entities together (e.g. zero or many). An example of this is a table full of customers and a table full of products available. A customer may buy several products or the may buy none. It is common to see zero or one, zero or many and one or many (although the many symbol by default means one or many).

								Ask an apprentice to explain this ERD. The student_course table holds a record for each course a student is enrolled on, meaning that one student will be referenced several times in that table (hence one to many). Likewise, due to the composite key, each course may also be referenced multiple times (it is possible only one student is enrolled on a course) but will have only one record in the course table. Hence one-or-many to one.

								(You may need to refresh screen if chart doesn't appear) Again ask apprentices to try and read this table. For each item sold in a transaction there will exist a unique row which will be identified by the transaction number, customer id and product id. This means that each customer can be referenced in several records in the transaction table, hence one to one-or-many. Likewise, a product can be sold more than once but will only have one record in the product table. Several products may be sold by the same supplier. If a transaction contains more than one product, they will likely be shipped together (but the shipping information will only appear in one record). However, a customer may choose to pick up the item in store, so it won't have been shipped, hence the one-or-many to zero-or-one relationship (we will ignore the case where a transaction can be shipped seperately). Several shipments may be carried by the same shipper. Finally, a customer may have bought several products across several transactions which is why there is a one-or-many to one relationship.

In the center is the fact table which holds all the measurements (e.g. price of products, quantity sold, etc) aggregated in various ways. Surrounding it are the dimension tables which provide the basis for aggregating the measurements in the fact table. This format allows you to intuitively understand much of the information around a piece of data, for example, for a given number of order dollars you will be able to find out what products were sold, to what customers and by what salesperson on a certain day.

              Ask the group to annotate the screen with their suggestions of what a source can be. Then show a few examples. A source is anything which holds data (typicaly structured in this case, but can be unstructured). Applications refers to software such as APIs which allow you to connect to databases.

              Ask the group to suggest the benefits of data integration. By integrating data from different sources into one location (warehouse) you are making your data more available to a wider range of people who need it which will allow for collaboration between different teams, more opportunities for insights and superior analysis. Additionally, with more eyes on the data you can be more confident of the integreity and quality.

              Batch uploads is the common approach for data warehouses where data is moved from source to target in groups periodically. This means the source and target are asynchronus (not in sync) which allows for the source to be updated at any time, the target will follow suit later. It is advised however that batch uploads happen outside working hours to avoid disruption to people trying to use the target file. Real time integration sees data moved from source to target as it is created. If the source updates, so does the target. This is optimal only for small amounts of data due to the processing time needed (think how slow and unresponsive a dashboard would be if it was integrating constantly terabytes worth of data).

                Introduce the five stages. In the first stage you will need to scope out the requirements for the integration- what technology do you need? Who will need access to the integrated target? What business questions will this integrated target be able to answer? What data/sources will be connected and do they need any work (i.e. cleaning)? This requirements elicitation is a necessary step as it will give you focus onto what you need to do as well as potentially mitigate and avoid costly errors later.

                Next comes profiling. You have already scoped out the data sources you are going to use, but are they in a useable format? You will need to check and clean the data (potentially writing scripts to automate this process) to ensure the sources will be in a consistent format with the target. You will also need to check if duplicates or nulls will be created as a result of the integration and mitigate for them.

                Now you have your sources identified and ready, you will need to decide on the structure of the data warehouse. The most common approach is the star schema, where measurements will be held in a central fact table in various aggregations as defined by the surrounding dimension tables. Based on the business need and technical opportunities you have available you will need to decide what is stored within the fact table and what dimensions you would like/need to include.

                Once you have the database designed and the sources identified and made ready it is time to test that it all works. You will need to validate the process (is the correct data being pulled? Is it joining on the columns I had set?) and verify the output (does it look like how you expected? Is it doing what you want it to?). There are various testing strategies available which we will look into later. If there are any failures, you will need to document them and then fix them. This should all be tested at a local level.

                Finally, if you are confident that everything works as intended then it is time to implement the process! This may involve training up colleagues or at least amking them aware the data warehouse exists. You should also schedule regular maintenance as well as a batch upload schedule (ideally out of work hours) that will allow the integration process to be updated.

              With data (particularly PII or insider data) the question has to be, does this person need access? GDPR states that data must be processed in a manner which secures its security and used in a way which is relevant. A way to ensure this is to only give access to those who need it, so having a set of security policies and rules (including how to get access approval and how they data should be used) should be established. To help protect data integrity, the data itself should not be changed once it has been integrated- it should be in the form exactly as you defined it. You should caary out validation checks throughout the process to ensure the source data is in the correct form, the column names are mapping correctly and other errors (such as incorrect data types, null values and outliers) are identified and dealt with. You should also check that there isn't a 'back door' that will allow users (potentially malicious) to gain access.

                Like any intellectual property, the owner has the right who can have (and not have) access. This will need to be justified in a business context (if internal) and potentially have a contract drawn up (if external) to gain access. Normally the process to request access is as follows: you make the request, someone will review the request (potentially clarifying details), a database administrator (DBA) will grant access (if approved) and provide instructions on how you can retreive or connect the data. Access permission should be reviewed regularly, with permissions updated or removed as necessary.

              This process is how data is collected from a variety of disparate sources and combined into one unified target view. Consider your organisation, it will likely be split into several teams and divisions, each collecting and storing data relevant to their roles. Sales teams will hold data on customers while the inventory team know how much they have left in stock. For key decision makers in the company, they will want all of this data in one central location so they can get a quick view to understand the situation and make data driven decisions. This is what ETL is for, combing data from across an organisation into one central place (often a data warehouse).

              <aside class='notes'>
                The first stage in the process is extraction. This is when you identify and collect the data from all the sources you require. Note, you don't 'take' the data but a copy is made and sent to the warehouse. This means the original source is left untouched. It also means that if any changes are made to the source, these will not be reflected in the warehouse until an update is made. A consequence of this is that warehouses are static (making querying and processing quicker) but potentially out of date if the source changes (fast flowing databases like sales or inventory will change throughout the day, so ETL updates may need to happen regularly). Often when a warehouse is updated it will need to be taken 'offline' so extraction tends to happen outside of working hours to avoid disruption for users. You will validate your sources at this time to ensure they contain the correct information.

              <aside class='notes'>
                Once the data has been pulled to the warehouse it is time to transform it. This means all the data needs to be in the same consistent format- data types need to be the same, null values should be removed and column names should be consistent (especially if they appear in more than one source- more on this in our next module). Note, as the data is copied from the source, the original data is unchanged by this process.

              <aside class='notes'>
                Finally, once the data is in a consistent format it is time to join it all together into one table. At this point you will verify that the data stored is correct and useful for the purposes you require. A few things to note, with large voluminous (and potentially fast flowing) data this process may be more cost effective to be run using a Big Data technology which uses a form of parallel processing to carry this out. As mentioned earlier, data warehouses are static and can quickly be out of date with the the original sources. It is highly likely then that an ETL process will be carried out regularly to ensure decision makers always have access to the latest data.

              The benefits of ETL are that data from across a business can be stored in one central location allowing key decision makers to make data driven decisions quickly. It also allows for teams across a business to collaborate and share their data (sales teams acting on the advice of their inventory/data teams). It also means different teams are using consistent formats allowing for errors to be quickly identified and fixed.

                A possible project for your portfolio could be to build a data warehouse or pipeline for someone in your business. If this is the case, make sure you capture the business requirements clearly before beginning. This way you can guide the process precisely and be able to verify at the end if you have met the requirements of the stakeholder.
