						The first thing we will be looking at is the data life cycle- what happens to a piece of data from the moment it is created to when it is finally deleted. It is important to have this understanding as it will help you understand the data you are using and assess whether it is relevant or not.

					</div>
					<!-- Slide 7 Notes -->
					<aside class='notes'>
						The data life cycle comes in 6 stages (although you only need to know about 5 for your exam, usage is something we add on). The cycle describes the journey from how data is created and stored, to how it is used before being archived and assessing when it becomes obsolete. At that point it should be deleted. Let's go through each stage in detail.

							First comes Genesis, where has the data come from? Is it data collected by an organisation (such as transaction, client or customer data)? Has it come through research? What is the data type? Is it structured or unstructured? Understanding these facets of your data will inform you what sorts of analysis you can carry out as well as what visualisations you can prepare.

							Once data has been created it needs to be stored somewhere. What type of database (relational, NoSQL, etc)? Is it stored in a data warehouse? There also comes questions around security- who has access? How often is access reviewed? Is the data being stored in a way that complies with GDPR? In your portfolio you will need to demonstrate an understanding of how the data you use is stored, and what protocols you have followed to gain access. Does the data contain PII? If so, what have you done to ensure it is secure?

						<!-- Slide 8c Notes -->
						<aside class='notes'>
							Data usage refers to (obviously) how you use the data. How often do you plan to use it? You might plan to use it once for a piece of statistical analysis, or you might need it continuously for a dashboard. You should also consider who has access, and what your organisation says you can do with it. A lot of this again pertains to GDPR which states you can only use data for relevant purposes.

							Something to consider with data is how long it is useful for. GDPR states that you musn't hold data for any longer than is necessary, so if you aren't using it what are you going to do with it? If you think you might need it again in the future (for comparisons) then you may want to archive it.

							You should also consider if the data is in fact relevant. Do you actually need it? All data has a working life and eventually it will become obsolete, you need to ask these questions therefore to help you decide if the data is still useful. In your portfolio you shuld show evidence of your understanding of the working life of data.

						We have considered what happens to a piece of data, but what about a project? Today's session is about helping you understand how to plan out a project that will deliver data driven insights. The data analytics lifecycle is a framework which all your projects are based around.

						<!-- Slide 11a Notes -->
						<aside class='notes'>
							The data analytics life cycle governs every aspect of your project from its genesis to final completion. You should refer to each of these steps throughout (especially when writing up your portfolio). It is important to point out this life cycle flows both ways. It is common to go back a step when you realise something is missing from your data, or you need to readjust your plan due to an unforseen issue. Be flexible in your project and learn from everything you do to optimise your practice.

							Next comes data prep. 80% of your time on a data project will be spent on this section, checking for null values, missing values, data types, outliers, errors and more. A project lives or dies on the quality of its data, you need to ensure it is in the optimal shape.

							Once you have prepared the data you analyse it. You calculate aggregates (means and medians, counts, maximum and minimums) and visualise the data.

							Once the model is built, it is time to refine and compare. When building models it is rare that you would only make one, and you may have considered a variety of visualisations for your dashboard. It is in this stage that you optimise what you have built and decide upon which version meets your project aims best.

							Almost anyone can be a stakeholder but we can simplify them into four groups
							<ul>
								<li> Sponsors: those who issue the project, like those who you report into </li>
								<li> Team: those who are on the same level as you and who you have to collaborate with </li>
								<li> Users: the clients or customers who will make use of your output. Note a user and a customer may be different- a customer pays for the product whereas a user 'uses' it, for example a company will pay for a service while the employees use it. </li>
								<li> Suppliers: those whose input is required for the project to be completed (could be an external data source or subject expert) </li>
							</ul>
							For each stakeholder you need to consider how involved they will be with your project and therefore what influence they will have, the next few slides will help structure this process.

						It may be useful then to visualise your stakeholders on this chart. All stakeholders can be modelled on how much power (influence) they have over your project and how interested they are. For example, your line manager will have high power and interest so will need to be managed closely whereas your line manager's boss will have high power but low interest which means you just need to keep them happy. Ask the apprentices to suggest other people who could fall into each category. Note, throughout the life cycle of a project someone's position on the chart may change. A member of the sales team will be in the 'monitor' box in the initial stages of a project but will need to be managed closely as it moves close to production.

						The first thing to consider is if we understand their requirements. Requirements elicitation is a key aspect of a project where you capture their needs so you can draw up a project brief (will be discussed in more detail later). A key aspect of this is the questions you ask.

					<!-- Slide 40 Notes -->
					<aside class='notes'>
						A concept that you need to be aware of in a project is validation vs verification. Whatever your project is you need to be clear on success metrics and how how you have met them. In your project brief you should be clear on where and when you will validate or verify your work, and what it will look like.

					<h1> <b style='color:#ff7c66'>Verfication</b></h1>
					<br>
					<p> The internal process of evaluating a data project to determine whether the products of a given development phase satisfy the conditions imposed at the start. This includes:</p>

						<li> Design Analysis </li>
						<li> Specification Analysis </li>
					</ul>
					<!-- Slide 41 Notes -->

						Verification occurs when you want to check if your project has met the requirements of a given phase- for example, does your dashboard show the correct information? Does it work as intended? Is your data pipeline accessible? Whenever you are ready to move onto the next phase of a project you should verify that the success conditions have been met.

						<span class='title'> Setting a Hypothesis</span>          
					</div>
					<!-- Slide 43 Notes -->
					<aside class='notes'>
						The final part of planning we will look at today is setting a hypothesis. It is possible that your project will inform some sort of statistical analysis (for example to check if a new process reduces the time to calculate KPIs). If there is going to be some sort of analysis, you should include as part of your project brief the hypothesis you will set.

							<td> Assumes what you are investigating is true </td>
						</tr>

					<!-- Slide 44 Notes -->
					<aside class='notes'>
						There are two types of hypothesis, null and alternate. The null hypothesis assumes nothing has changed and that the status quo is correct. The alternate hypothesis assumes that somethig has changed as a result of your work. You would then set a statistical test to investigate your data and see which hypothesis is correct. Typically you would check to see if the null hypothesis is true, and if not would then go in favour of the alternate.

					<!-- Slide 45 Notes -->
					<aside class='notes'>
						For example, you could be trying to investigate if studying affects the outcome of an exam. Your null hypothesis is that there is no effect and your alternate hypothesis is that there is an effect. You would then collect data from student's asking them to record the number of hours they spent studying and perform some test to correlate these with their test scores. Based off these results you would conclude either there is no relationship (null hypothesis) or would reject the null and accept the alternate saying that there is a relationship.
