						You have written your project brief, you have identified stakeholders and agreed deliverables and deadline- but what about the data you are going to use? There is a wide variety of models or visualisations you can choose from when planning a project but to pick the best one requires you to know your data. You need to know how it is structured, what type it is and what permissions exist. This is what we are going to look at today, with first us considering the types of data that exist.

						To help illustrate why understanding our data is important, ask aprpentices to annotate the screen with examples of what can go wrong with our data (e.g. missing data, null values, incorrect data, outliers, dubious column (field) names, etc). A lot of these issues can be mitigated for by understanding our data.

							Quantitative data is numerical from which we can calculate aggregates such as mean, median, range and standard deviation. Most visualisations require this type of data (bar charts, box plots, scatter graphs, etc) as we can visualise amounts. The first subset is discrete data, and this is numerical data you can count (or you can think of it as the count of qualitative data) for example, number of marbles in a bag, number of customers in an hour, etc.

							Continuous data can be measured, like temperature, weight or heights. Often you can treat discrete data as continuous when there are too many 'options' (e.g. money). Ask the group if they think age is continuous or discrete.

						<!-- Slide 9a Notes -->
						<aside class='notes'>
							With qualitative data we are looking at information that describes the quality of something. Some visualisations do exist for this data type (word clouds for example) but often the best way to visualise it is to take the discrete count of each possible category. Binomial data occurs when there are only two options.

							When nominal data has order then it becomes ordinal. For example, when given a scale from extremely unhappy to extremely happy (likert scale) it becomes ordinal. Ordinal data may be numeric (on a scale from 1 to 5). In this case you have discrete labels (which can be analysed), but the scale itself is qualitative (for example, on a scale from 1 to 5, '3' is a label indicating 'average')

						Client data is proprietary data not owned by your organisation, but given to you by a client.

Again, this data will be sensitive so must be kept secure and used only for its intended purpose.

An organisation may want to make use of this data repository to help them make data driven decisions. Often accessed using an API.

What are the limitations of the data? Is it able to help us solve our business problems? Will we be able to connect it to our current infrastructure? Do we understand everything we need to about the data? Are we even allowed to use it? If the data is proprietary to someone else and you don't have their permission, you cannot use it.

						In 2018 the General Data Protection Regulation was introduced for all companies that operate in the European Economic Area. This supersedes the DPA and it is important in your portfolio that you demonstrate that you are aware of it and have complied. Even though the UK has left the EU, most organisations still work with EU based clients and therefore still have to adhere. The penalities for non compliance can be severe with harsh fines, loss of customer confidence and poor market reputation if any breaches occur. GDPR (and the DPA) exist to protect personal data (such as name, contact information, IP address, personal information, political preferences and more). It is esnetial then if you are working with this sort of data that you demonstrate compliance and explicitly state what you have done to protect it.

							Data can either be structured or unstructured. Structured data is your typical rows and columns and is usually stored in databases or data warehouses. They are easy to query and build models out of. Unstructured data is anything else, for example pictures, audio or video files and word documents. These types of data are typically stoed in data lakes or NoSQL databases and are difficult to analyse and extract information from using a machine.

							You will use structured and unstructured data regularly throughout your role and life. For example, structured data is used in reservation systems, inventory or client control and other systems where the data is in a simple row and column structure. Every day processes like emails, word processing, presentations and more are examples of unstructured data. Most of the data you receive in life is unstructured, yet you are able to process it (think about all the sensory information your brain processes every minute- you integrate audio, video, oratory and physical information without even realising!). The challenge then is building machine processes to analyse this data as well, which is a major area of research within data science. What sort of things do you do to analyse unstructured data in your role?

							Unstructured data is anything that isn't in a structured format like audio files, emails and reports. Most of the data you use will be unstructured in your role, but the data you analyse will likely be structured. This sort of data is difficult to analyse and therefore you need to be aware of this when starting your project- if you know it is going to be unstructured you need to plan for how you will deal with it (where is it coming from? How will you store and process it?). This should be stated in your project brief and in your portfolio when describing how you planned out your project.

							A quick note, data may look structured but isn't. For example, an Excel spreadsheet is <b> unstructured </b>. The data within may be in a structured format which you can analyse, but the sheet itself isn't. This is because Excel doesn't have to conform to structured rules- you don't need column names, columns don't need to have the same amount of information, you can have multiple tables in a single sheet. So while the data within the spreadsheet can be structured, the sheet itself isn't.

						We tend to think of data as being in a row and column format, but that is not the only way it can be given to us. For example, data often comes in files (can anyone think of an example? CSV, XLSX, JSON, etc). The data contained within the file itself can be structured or unstructured depending on what type it is, in a few minutes we will look into file types in more detail. A list is a a 1-dimensional (think a single row) object where all the data is stored and is the basic building block of structured data. When we start to add more dimensions (rows and columns for example) the data becomes an array where we locate the data using indices (think coordinates). Most of the data we use is 2-dimensional (row and column) but it is possible to have more dimensions. A 2-dimensional array becomes a table (the one you will be most familiar with) when the rows and columns are labelled (records and fields), this is your typical structured data. Finally a tree, where data is defined by its relationship to each other. An exmaple of this is folders on your computer.

							XML is a markup language, ask if anyone knows about any other markup languages (HTML). If you right click on the page and select inspect you will be able to see the HTML for this presentation. Webscraping tools exist to extract data from this format and can move it into a more structured format. CSV files are very common and when we get to the data science portion of the course we will be importing mostly CSV files as they are easy for python to process (CSV files are structured). RTF is also a markup language and is the basis for Microsoft Word files. Microsoft Office is able to open both CSV and RTF in a human readable format. Click on the hyperlinks to show the CSV is opened as an excel file and RTF is opened as a Word File.

							Text files are very lightweight and easy to use. When writing scripts for automation you will often use a text file for the computer to process. Excel files are also very common but actually quite difficult for other processors to use. Finally we have JSON, if you ever extract data from an API it is likely it will be in a JSON format. They can be described as nested dictionaries and to extract the information you will need to know which parts to query. Which file types do you commonly use in your role?

						This process is how data is collected from a variety of disparate sources and combined into one unified target view. Consider your organisation, it will likely be split into several teams and divisions, each collecting and storing data relevant to their roles. Sales teams will hold data on customers while the inventory team know how much they have left in stock. For key decision makers in the company, they will want all of this data in one central location so they can get a quick view to understand the situation and make data driven decisions. This is what ETL is for, combing data from across an organisation into one central place (often a data warehouse).

							The first stage in the process is extraction. This is when you identify and collect the data from all the sources you require. Note, you don't 'take' the data but a copy is made and sent to the warehouse. This means the original source is left untouched. It also means that if any changes are made to the source, these will not be reflected in the warehouse until an update is made. A consequence of this is that warehouses are static (making querying and processing quicker) but potentially out of date if the source changes (fast flowing databases like sales or inventory will change throughout the day, so ETL updates may need to happen regularly). Often when a warehouse is updated it will need to be taken 'offline' so extraction tends to happen outside of working hours to avoid disruption for users. You will validate your sources at this time to ensure they contain the correct information.

							Once the data has been pulled to the warehouse it is time to transform it. This means all the data needs to be in the same consistent format- data types need to be the same, null values should be removed and column names should be consistent (especially if they appear in more than one source- more on this in our next module). Note, as the data is copied from the source, the original data is unchanged by this process.

							Finally, once the data is in a consistent format it is time to join it all together into one table. At this point you will verify that the data stored is correct and useful for the purposes you require. A few things to note, with large voluminous (and potentially fast flowing) data this process may be more cost effective to be run using a Big Data technology which uses a form of parallel processing to carry this out. As mentioned earlier, data warehouses are static and can quickly be out of date with the the original sources. It is highly likely then that an ETL process will be carried out regularly to ensure decision makers always have access to the latest data.

						The benefits of ETL are that data from across a business can be stored in one central location allowing key decision makers to make data driven decisions quickly. It also allows for teams across a business to collaborate and share their data (sales teams acting on the advice of their inventory/data teams). It also means different teams are using consistent formats allowing for errors to be quickly identified and fixed.
