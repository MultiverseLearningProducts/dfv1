					<!-- Slide 9 Notes -->
					<aside class='notes'>
						We have considered what happens to a piece of data, but what about a project? Today's session is about helping you understand how to plan out a project that will deliver data driven insights. The data analytics lifecycle is a framework which all your projects are based around.

						</div>
						<!-- Slide 10a Notes -->
						<aside class='notes'>
							The data analytics life cycle governs every aspect of your project from its genesis to final completion. You should refer to each of these steps throughout (especially when writing up your portfolio). It is important to point out this life cycle flows both ways. It is common to go back a step when you realise something is missing from your data, or you need to readjust your plan due to an unforseen issue. Be flexible in your project and learn from everything you do to optimise your practice.

							Once you have prepared the data you analyse it. You calculate aggregates (means and medians, counts, maximum and minimums) and visualise the data.

								<li> Team: those who are on the same level as you and who you have to collaborate with </li>
								<li> Users: the clients or customers who will make use of your output. Note a user and a customer may be different- a customer pays for the product whereas a user 'uses' it, for example a company will pay for a service while the employees use it. </li>
								<li> Suppliers: those whose input is required for the project to be completed (could be an external data source or subject expert) </li>
							</ul>
							For each stakeholder you need to consider how involved they will be with your project and therefore what influence they will have, the next few slides will help structure this process.

						It may be useful then to visualise your stakeholders on this chart. All stakeholders can be modelled on how much power (influence) they have over your project and how interested they are. For example, your line manager will have high power and interest so will need to be managed closely whereas your line manager's boss will have high power but low interest which means you just need to keep them happy. Ask the apprentices to suggest other people who could fall into each category. Note, throughout the life cycle of a project someone's position on the chart may change. A member of the sales team will be in the 'monitor' box in the initial stages of a project but will need to be managed closely as it moves close to production.

              Communication is not as simple as just talking to someone; to elicit information from someone there is a whole range of methods you should consider. For example, a lot of communication is verbal (speaking) but that also includes emails and memos. What sort of things should you try to keep in mind when communicating verbally? (Grammar, appropriate use of language, tone, saying what you mean, etc). What is often overlooked however is non verbal communication. Humans are generally quite good at picking up body language, even subconsciously, which can create problems if you are not thinking about it. For example, if you are trying to win a client, looking at your phone will not go down very well. What other types of non verbal communication should we be considering when communicating with stakeholders?

              One of the more common methods of communication with stakeholders is the humble email, does anyone have any advice from their experience with writing emails to stakeholders? What should you consider? A lot depends on the stakeholder itself, you can be a lot less formal with a peer than a senior manager. If in doubt, it always better to be formal and succinct, giving enough detail so they understand without overloading them. What sort of things should we consider with face to face meeting (whether in person or over Zoom/Teams)? Body language, how we look and speak, being clear and concise and knowing our subject material. When communicating with stakeholders it is important we have a flexible and adaptive style. How you communicate with your manager will be different with someone on your level and again different to someone who is external. What you will be assessed on in your portfolio is your ability to adapt your communication style to different audiences and situations.

              Something else you will be assessed on is how you work both independently and within a team. You are never alone on a project and will often have stakeholders you rely on (data engineers or database managers for example). It is important to consider how you work and communicate with these stakeholders as they will have an impact on the outcome of your project. When writing up project reports, or communicating to primary stakeholdersit is important to detail exactly what you did on the project and how effective that contribution was.

            When writing a project brief you will need to consider user experience. How will it look, feel and be useable for them? For example, if you are building a dashboard then you will need to think about if it is accessible- can they read it to make actionable insights? Will it conform to company policy on design and colour scheme? Will it be easy to use and look 'polished'? Understanding how the user will experience your project output is a key part of the requirements elicitation process.

            An important part of the requirements elicitation process in understanding the context of the domain you are working in. Data analysis is never done in isolation, but always with reference to the industry and business it is in. What works for the automobile industry may not apply to cosmetics or the tech industry. When starting a project you will need to consider how your project fits into the wider business structure and the commercial (or business) impact it will have. When communicating your insights, you should put them in the context of the industry you are in. In your portfolio, you will be assessed on how you explain/consider domain context in your analysis.

							Data analytics is used in business to help organisations make better business decisions. <br>
							Whether it’s market research, product research, positioning, customer reviews, sentiment analysis, or any other issue for which data exists, analysing data will provide insights that organisations need in order to make the right choices.<br>
							Data analytics is important for businesses today, because data-driven choices are the only way to be truly confident in business decisions. Some successful businesses may be created on a hunch, but almost all successful business choices are data-based. <br>
							When writing your project briefs you will need to be clear on what type of analysis you are going to do, and in your portfolio explain why it is the appropriate choice. The next few slides will cover 4 main types of analytics.

							Diagnostic analysis is about uncovering the root cause of what you observed in your descriptive analysis. For example, you observe revenue increased in October- why did that happen? Which marketing effort contributed the most? Diagnostic analysis can be about investigating positive or negative occurrences and trying to work out what caused them so you can make necessary adjustments.

							In this type of analysis you will look at past trends in your data to make predictions in the future. This could be using time series forecasting or building basic machine learning regression or classification models. For example, to predict next year's revenue you will need to analyse trends from the past few years to build a picture of what is happening in the market. Predictive analytics can be applied to very complex issues such as risk assessment, sales forecasting and qualifying leads.

							Combining the other three types of analysis together gives prescriptive analytics. This is when you use your analysis to give stakeholders your recommendation on what should be done- this is where data-driven choices are made. For example, you could find from your diagnostic analysis that there is an issue with a product so you recommend a plan to boost sales. Or, you may have built a model to predict customers defaulting on loans, so you advise stakeholders on which customers are most likely to default so they can for a plan. Whatever type of analytics you plan to do, you should include this in your project brief and portfolio.
