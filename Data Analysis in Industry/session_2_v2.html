					<!-- Slide 4 Notes -->
					<aside class='notes'>
            The focus on the previous session was identifying and managing stakeholders to ensure success in our projects. However, we alo need to consider the data we are going to use. The process of categorising our data so it can be efficiently and effectively protected is called data classification. It is an important and necessary step in the data analytics life cycle due to issues relating to compliance and regulation. You must demonstrate this process in your portfolio.

					<!-- Slide 5 Notes -->
					<aside class='notes'>
						What should we consider as part of the data classification process? We should consider data types and storage as this will help us identify how the data can be used. We should think about its source as that will determine what we can do with it and how much we can trust it. We also need to consider if we are handling any sensitive data, how we are protecting it and controlling access. The rest of the session will help us answer these questions. Do you think there is anything else that should be included? In your portfolio you will need to demonstrate a reasoned application of data classification, including describing any flexibilities you have applied and its purpose (e.g. how your handling of PII complied with GDPR).

            Anything to do with data classification can be summarised into these three areas:
            <ul>
              <li> Content- what is in our data? This includes checking for sensitive data such as PII, key performance indicators and other information that company would rather not be made publically available. </li>
              <li> Context- Check the application, location and owners of the data. How is it being used? Who has access? When are the accessing it? </li>
              <li> USer- What do you know about the data? Using your knowledge and discretion, go through and flag anything that could be sensitive.
            </ul>

						The first part of data classification is looking at the data itself. Data can come in a variety of formats and could contain many different things. Let's look at the different types of data we can encounter. [Note, we are talking high level quantitative vs qualitative at this point, try to avoid specific programming data types like strings for now- we will cover them later].

						Data can described in one of two ways- quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative data is numerical (think quantities) and can be subdivided into discrete and continuous. Qualitative data is categorical (qualities) and is broken down into binomial, nominal and ordinal.

						<!-- Slide 9a Notes -->
						<aside class='notes'>
							Quantitative data is numerical from which we can calculate aggregates such as mean, median, range and standard deviation. Most visualisations require this type of data (bar charts, box plots, scatter graphs, etc) as we can visualise amounts. The first subset is discrete data, and this is numerical data you can count (or you can think of it as the count of qualitative data) for example, number of marbles in a bag, number of customers in an hour, etc.

						<aside class='notes'>
							Continuous data can be measured, like temperature, weight or heights. Often you can treat discrete data as continuous when there are too many 'options' (e.g. money). Ask the group if they think age is continuous or discrete.

						<!-- Slide 10a Notes -->
						<aside class='notes'>
							With qualitative data we are looking at information that describes the quality of something. Some visualisations do exist for this data type (word clouds for example) but often the best way to visualise it is to take the discrete count of each possible category. Binomial data occurs when there are only two options.

						<!-- Slide 10c Notes -->
						<aside class='notes'>
							When nominal data has order then it becomes ordinal. For example, when given a scale from extremely unhappy to extremely happy (likert scale) it becomes ordinal. Ordinal data may be numeric (on a scale from 1 to 5). In this case you have discrete labels (which can be analysed), but the scale itself is qualitative (for example, on a scale from 1 to 5, '3' is a label indicating 'average')

							Data can either be structured or unstructured. Structured data is your typical rows and columns and is usually stored in databases or data warehouses. They are easy to query and build models out of. Unstructured data is anything else, for example pictures, audio or video files and word documents. These types of data are typically stoed in data lakes or NoSQL databases and are difficult to analyse and extract information from using a machine.

							You will use structured and unstructured data regularly throughout your role and life. For example, structured data is used in reservation systems, inventory or client control and other systems where the data is in a simple row and column structure. Every day processes like emails, word processing, presentations and more are examples of unstructured data. Most of the data you receive in life is unstructured, yet you are able to process it (think about all the sensory information your brain processes every minute- you integrate audio, video, oratory and physical information without even realising!). The challenge then is building machine processes to analyse this data as well, which is a major area of research within data science. What sort of things do you do to analyse unstructured data in your role?

							Unstructured data is anything that isn't in a structured format like audio files, emails and reports. Most of the data you use will be unstructured in your role, but the data you analyse will likely be structured. This sort of data is difficult to analyse and therefore you need to be aware of this when starting your project- if you know it is going to be unstructured you need to plan for how you will deal with it (where is it coming from? How will you store and process it?). This should be stated in your project brief and in your portfolio when describing how you planned out your project.

							A quick note, data may look structured but isn't. For example, an Excel spreadsheet is <b> unstructured </b>. The data within may be in a structured format which you can analyse, but the sheet itself isn't. This is because Excel doesn't have to conform to structured rules- you don't need column names, columns don't need to have the same amount of information, you can have multiple tables in a single sheet. So while the data within the spreadsheet can be structured, the sheet itself isn't.

						We tend to think of data as being in a row and column format, but that is not the only way it can be given to us. For example, data often comes in files (can anyone think of an example? CSV, XLSX, JSON, etc). The data contained within the file itself can be structured or unstructured depending on what type it is, in a few minutes we will look into file types in more detail. A list is a a 1-dimensional (think a single row) object where all the data is stored and is the basic building block of structured data. When we start to add more dimensions (rows and columns for example) the data becomes an array where we locate the data using indices (think coordinates). Most of the data we use is 2-dimensional (row and column) but it is possible to have more dimensions. A 2-dimensional array becomes a table (the one you will be most familiar with) when the rows and columns are labelled (records and fields), this is your typical structured data. Finally a tree, where data is defined by its relationship to each other. An exmaple of this is folders on your computer.

						Client data is proprietary data not owned by your organisation, but given to you by a client.

Again, this data will be sensitive so must be kept secure and used only for its intended purpose.

            When considering data from your own organisation you will need to consider how it is classified so you do not run the risk of breaching company data policies or GDPR. The three questions you should ask yourself are, how easily can this data be used to identify an individual? How much damage could be done if it is leaked (both financially and to reputation)? How readily available is the data? If your answers to these three questions do not give you cause to panic, then you can treat the data as open source. If however, any do create a cause for concern then you should consider the data restricted to everyone but those who have been given access.

Do we understand everything we need to about the data? Are we even allowed to use it? If the data is proprietary to someone else and you don't have their permission, you cannot use it.

							XML is a markup language, ask if anyone knows about any other markup languages (HTML). If you right click on the page and select inspect you will be able to see the HTML for this presentation. Webscraping tools exist to extract data from this format and can move it into a more structured format. CSV files are very common and when we get to the data science portion of the course we will be importing mostly CSV files as they are easy for python to process (CSV files are structured). RTF is also a markup language and is the basis for Microsoft Word files. Microsoft Office is able to open both CSV and RTF in a human readable format.

							Text files are very lightweight and easy to use. When writing scripts for automation you will often use a text file for the computer to process. Excel files are also very common but actually quite difficult for other processors to use. Finally we have JSON, if you ever extract data from an API it is likely it will be in a JSON format. They can be described as nested dictionaries and to extract the information you will need to know which parts to query. Which file types do you commonly use in your role?

						There are many different types of database management system that can be used to store data, but the two most common are the relational database and NoSQL. Both allow for easy access to data for users with proper clearance. It is likely the data you use will be stored in such a database as it allows multiple users to access the data simultaneously, and so it can be monitored centrally. Imagine if the data you wanted was stored on one person's computer, accessing it would be a nightmare and security risks would be greater due to the possibility of the computer being lost/stolen and that it is not being supervised.

								<li> Completeness- Is all the data present? Are there missing values? Do the field names make sense? </li>
								<li> Consistency- Is there a consistent format throughout? Including, currency, data types, units, etc. Are there any outliers? </li>
								<li> Uniqueness- Is each record unique? Are there any duplicate values? Are real world entities represented more than once (e.g. apple and Apple)?</li>
								<li> Timeliness- Is the data up to date? Your data should be current with respect to the needs of the business </li>
							</ul>

							Often the data we recieve will not be clean, and there could be errors. What sort of errors might we come across? Missing values, corrupted data, outliers, incorrect values, wrong data types, etc. Generally when we come across a problem there three things we can do. We can correct the error, finding the correct value or fixing the mistake. We could impute a new value (replace the erroneous data with 0, or with the mean/median value for that field). If we cannot correct the mistake, or find a suitable value to replace it, you could remove the data point but this should only be done with caution as this could be difficult to undo. Another option would be to ignore the problem if you feel it won't affect your work, or if the error means something which should be investigated

							Whatever the issue is, whether it is unclean data, or a failure in the database itself, you must demonstrate that you have found a solution to the true root cause. For example, if the data is corrupted when you receive it, it is possible there is something wrong in the database. You should contact the database administrator so they can fix it. If you are collecting the data yourself and feeding it into a pipeline, you need to put into place checks to ensure high data quality and put in safeguards to protect corruption or erroneous data.

						In 2018 the General Data Protection Regulation was introduced for all companies that operate in the European Economic Area. It is important in your portfolio that you demonstrate that you are aware of it and how you have complied. Even though the UK has left the EU, most organisations still work with EU based clients and therefore still have to adhere. The penalities for non compliance can be severe with harsh fines, loss of customer confidence and poor market reputation if any breaches occur. GDPR (and the DPA) exist to protect personal data (such as name, contact information, IP address, personal information, political preferences and more). It is esnetial then if you are working with this sort of data that you demonstrate compliance and explicitly state what you have done to protect it. GDPR governs the ethical use of data, so let's dive a bit more deeply into it.

PII also includes data that can be reasonably put together to find something out about someone (e.g. house number + street name, where either on their own won't identify someone). Some of the data you use in your role may contain PII, whether it is internal (payroll) or on external clients or customers. When using PII, your organisation much follow the rules on the previous slide. In your portfolio you should state if you are using PII and what you are doing to protect it. Can anyone think of ways we can mask PII? You could anonymuse it or use pseudonames (id names) to change the way data is linked to a person.

						<aside class='notes'>
							Whenever you subscribe to a new service you will be asked to consent for your data to be used in a particular way. If as part of your work are collecting information directly from clients/customers then you will need to demonstrate an example of a consent form. Keep in mind that the form will need to inform the person what the data will be used for, where it will be stored, for how long, who else will have access, how they can access it, amend it and delete it to be GDPR compliant.

						<p><b> Article 4(11) GDPR</b></p>
						<!-- Slide 40c Notes -->
						<aside class='notes'>
							Article 7 of GDPR also states that you must keep records of consent. It cannot be stressed enough that PII must be given consenually and only under circumstances where the data owener understands how and why their data will be used.

					<!-- Slide 41 Notes -->
					<aside class='notes'>
						While GDPR states data should only be kept as long as necessary, it does not define an actual time limit. What you must rely on then, is your company's definition of reasonable use. If the data you are using does not meet the criteria it must be deleted, which includes all digital, hard and backup copies of the data. You cannot hold onto someone's data 'just in case'. When might data no longer be needed? E.g. client/customer has moved on, project has been completed, etc. If in one of your projects you have used PII, you will need to cite your companies policy on reasonable use and state the conditions upon which you will delete the data.

						We discussed storage earlier, but with PII you will need to state where it is going to be stored. You don't need to state the type of database, just where it is located (for example: on site, within company premises in another location or in the cloud). Gaining access to this data will be strictly controlled and there will be a series of procedures you would have to follow to get permission. For example, with customer data, you will need to present a clear business case for its use. Even then, a company may not give you direct access but only give you anonymised data or strip the PII away. In your portfolio you will need to state the procedure you followed to gain access and what you did to keep it secure.

					<!-- Slide 43 Notes -->
					<aside class='notes'>
						How do we keep data secure then? The simplest way is for companies to have defined policies and ensure all employees follow it through training. Data should be stored securely with special access permissions granted to those who have justified they need it. This access should regularly be reviewed, and where necessary have access revoked to those who no longer need it. The data should be processed on company machines or a secure VPN. If you are carrying hardware (laptop, USB) with PII you must ensure you are keeping it secure- the safest way is to leave it at work. As more data is being stored remotely it is becoming less likely that you will every 'carry' sensitive data, but if you do you must ensure it is being kept safe. You should document in your portfolio how you complied with your company's policy on data security.

					<!-- Slide 44 Notes -->
					<aside class='notes'>
						We will consider this more during the technical bootcamps, but whenever we are using data we need to consider the impact it can have on our lives- both personally and professionally. It is all too easy to build a model that is unintentionally biased or discriminatory due to the quality of the data we are using. Some PII is considered 'special categories' and includes race and ethnicity, gender, religious beliefs and political opinions. If you are using such data, it is your responsibility to ensure it is treated in such a way that does not lead to a biased outcome. The easiest way is to mask the data in such a way that each person can not be identified and so that it is then treated equally. It is the responsibility of all of us to contribute to a safe and secure working environment through the way we handle data. In your portfolio, where appropriate, you should discuss what you have done to promote the ethical use of data.
