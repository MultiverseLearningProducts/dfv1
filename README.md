         <h2> Intent </h2>
         <p> At Multiverse we aim to enable apprentices to be professionally competent Data Analysts through teaching them tools and concepts they will need to use everyday. At the heart of our curriculum is the data analytics lifecycle, a north star principle which helps apprentices to 'think data' and guide them throughout all aspects of their role and projects. 
         
         Learning is neither static or linear</p>
