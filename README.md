         <h2><b> Intent</b> </h2>
         <p> At Multiverse we aim to enable apprentices to be professionally competent Data Analysts through teaching them tools and concepts they will need to use everyday. At the heart of our curriculum is the data analytics lifecycle, a north star principle which helps apprentices to 'think data' and guide them throughout all aspects of their role and projects. </p>

         <p>Learning is not a straight path, but a spiral where we continually build on and extend prior learning to help apprentices gain new insights and fresh perspectives on how they can conduct their analysis. Throoughout the course we will return to techniques such as extracting, preparing, analysing, manipulating and visualising data through different tools and softwares such as Microsoft Excel, SQL, PowerBI, Python and R. At all stages we will review concepts and engage apprentices to consider which tools would be best used in their role to support their analysis, and justify this decision in their portfolio.</p>
         <br>
         <p> In the latter stages of the course we will visit data science concepts such as machine learning and encourage apprentices to build their own predictive models to leverage better insights from their data. </p>

                  <p> In this module we will be covering various tools apprentices will need to enhance their analytics performance in their roles. In the first half of the session we will give an overview of Big Data, considering how it works and what the benefits and drawbacks are of using it. This is followed by a discussion around data analytics platforms and comparing their usage to coding it yourself. </p>
                  <br>
                  <p> In the second part of the module we will be looking into the statistical programming language R, briefly looking at how many of the processes we learned in Python can be performed in R. </p>
