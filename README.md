         <h2><b> Intent</b> </h2>
         <p> At Multiverse we aim to enable apprentices to be professionally competent Data Analysts through teaching them tools and concepts they will need to use everyday. At the heart of our curriculum is the data analytics lifecycle, a north star principle which helps apprentices to 'think data' and guide them throughout all aspects of their role and projects. </p>

         <p>Learning is not a straight path, but a spiral where we continually build on and extend prior learning to help apprentices gain new insights and fresh perspectives on how they can conduct their analysis. Throoughout the course we will return to techniques such as extracting, preparing, analysing, manipulating and visualising data through different tools and softwares such as Microsoft Excel, SQL, PowerBI, Python and R. At all stages we will review concepts and engage apprentices to consider which tools would be best used in their role to support their analysis, and justify this decision in their portfolio.</p>
         <br>
         <p> In the latter stages of the course we will visit data science concepts such as machine learning and encourage apprentices to build their own predictive models to leverage better insights from their data. </p>
